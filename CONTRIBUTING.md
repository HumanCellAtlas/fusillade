# Contributing Guidelines
Contributions to HCA working group repos are subject to overall HCA
governance and technical guidance. In addition, contributors are
expected to abide by the following guidelines.

1. Rough consensus and running code: instead of formal procedures for
  agreeing on everything, systems with working prototypes and existing
  users are prioritized as platforms for discussion.

1. Keep it simple: prioritize scalability and the ability to keep the
  project easy to understand and scale over features. Use
  well-supported upstream solutions where possible. Provide useful
  defaults and don't expose unnecessary configuration options.

1. Separation of concerns and layers: (TODO: elaborate)

1. Don't break the build: pull requests are expected to pass all
  automated CI checks.

1. Keep the build simple: Automated CI checks that are fragile or don't
  serve a clear agreed upon purpose will be removed.

1. All Pull Request comments must be addressed, even after merge.

1. All code must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member.

1. All Pull Requests relating to an issue must include "connected to 
  #123", where #123 is the issue number.

1. Individual commit messages should clearly express the commit's purpose.
